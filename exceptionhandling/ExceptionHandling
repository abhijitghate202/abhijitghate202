- To handle runtime errors

1) Checked Exception - Exception should be handled first otherwise it wont run
    - compile time exception
    - IO Exception , SQL Exception

2) Unchecked Exception - it does not matter
    - Run time Exception

Error - irrecoverable

Throwable
          - Exception
                    - IO Exception
                    - Sql Exception
                    - ClassNotFoundException
                    - FileNotFoundException
                    - RunTimeException
                            - ArithmeticException : If we divide any number by zero then
                            - NullPointerException : If we have null value in any variable. eg- String s1 = null
                            - IndexOutOfBoundException : When an Array exceeds to its size.
                            - NumberFormatException : Converting string variable into digit. eg- parseInt

          - Error
                    - StackOverFlowError
                    - OutOfMemoryError
                    - VirtualMachineError

Reasons for exceptions:
1. Invalid user input
2. network connection error
3. Out of memory

1. try
	- place an exception code
	- must be followed by either catch or finally

2. catch
	- handle the exception
	- without try not allow

3. finally
	- to execute code like closing the connection
	- always executed whether exception is handled or not
	- eg. closing the file, closing database connection
	- only one finally block
4. throw
	- to throw an exception explicitly
    - can throw either checked or unchecked exception
5. throws
    -Declare the exception
    - Suppress the Exception

    	throw                           throws
    1. used to throw an                declare the exception
       exception explicitly

    2. can only propagate             can used to propagate checked &
       the unchecked exceptions       unchecked exception

    3. within a method                with method signature
